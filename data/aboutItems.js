I experienced burnout midway through my career in medicine. My life was mundane, routine and lacked fulfillment. I went from one \"TO DO\" list to another, day after day. I had no time for self care, hobbies or free time. I was physically AND emotionally exhausted. My relationships suffered. I made great money, had a big house and fancy cars, but I felt unfulfilled.",

I feel empowered. Yes, I’ve been to my own workshop and done the difficult work to get here! I want to show others how to reclaim joy in their careers and personal lives.",
