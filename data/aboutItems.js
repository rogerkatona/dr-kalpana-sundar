        title: "Why choose Dr. Sundar as your speaker?",
        description: "Life is a canvas, and like artists, we have the power to create and recreate ourselves as often as we feel is necessary. I experienced burnout midway through my career in medicine. My life was mundane, routine and lacked fulfillment. I went from one “TO DO” list to another, day after day.  I had no time for self care, hobbies or free time.  I was physically AND emotionally exhausted. My relationships suffered. I made great money, had a big house and fancy cars, but I felt unfulfilled.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Today I look at my life with joy.  I enjoy and am inspired by my work. I have strong relationships. I have time to nourish myself and pursue activities that excite me.  I feel empowered.  Yes, I’ve been to my own workshop and done the difficult work to get here!  I want to show others how to reclaim joy in their careers and personal lives.\n",
